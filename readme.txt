Adds a customizable meta widget for the sidebar

== Description ==

This plugin provides an alternative to the WordPress Meta widget. It also shows by default the same 5 links (register, login or logout, entries RSS, comments RSS and the link to wordpress.org. But it allows you to hide the ones you do not want to see.

Additionally it allows displaying a few other links:
- A password lost link
- Edit this page/post link
- Dashboard (site admin) link

These three links can also be hidden or shown. They will also only display if appropriate (depending on whether the user is logged in, which its rights, the type of page...).

The third improvement is that you can add any number of additional links by selecting a links category to be displayed in the meta box.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `meta-widget-customizer.php.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or a subfolder (e.g. `/wp-content/plugins/meta-widget-customizer/`)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add the widget (Meta Widget Customizer) to your sidebar
4. Select which links you want to have displayed
